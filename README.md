Research question:
Is there a correlation between the availability of community residential mental health facilities and suicide rates in adolescents ( 15-19 years old ) in north american countries?


Expected coding work to be done:
Firstly, we will need to read in our datasets for analysis. To analyze the data, we will run various statistical correlational tests in Python to identify if there is a valid correlation between our independent and dependent variables, suicide rates and mental health availability, respectively. We will then use Python functions to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient and use the results of our tests to create scatter plots. 


Possible Packages to be used:
The packages we intend to use are SciPy, NumPy, and Panda, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, pearsonR.


Possible Datasets to be used (at least 2):
Suicide rate estimates of 15-19 year olds by country: https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.MHSUICIDE1519?lang=en
Mental health service facilities availability by country: https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.MHCAREDEL?lang=en


Any considerations that need to be taken into account:
The data for suicide rate estimates of 15-19 year olds by country was last updated in 2021, which is relatively recent. However, the data for the availability of mental health services was last updated in 2019. Due to the discrepancy in the recency of the data, it is possible that our results will not be of the utmost statistical accuracy. It is important to take this into consideration when conducting our final analyses. 




Expected results (Consult instructor if you don’t have an idea):
We predict that there will be a distinct and statistically significant correlation between suicide rates in adolescents, aged 15-19, and mental health availability as mental illness and a lack of therapy can lead to suicidal thoughts and an overall sense of depression. On the contrary, adolescents have recently shown heightened senses of loneliness all around the world, even with mental health services available, so, we need to take into consideration that this data analysis could also show this aspect of the relationship.
